# First Pygame

This is my first game created using Python (Pygame).
It was created as a part of Intro to Software Systems Assignment (Semester 2).

### Running Instructions
Make sure that python3 & pygame is installed in your system. Now run `python3 run.py`

### Modifying Game
Without any knowledge of the code you can easily change many things in the game using the config file. Open `/data/config.ini` and change whatever you want ;)

Enjoy!
